# ZSH-Config
My customized .zshrc settigns 


## How to use this Repository
This Repository does not reflect a full .zshrc configuration file. It is just a basic configuration. To import the settings clone the respository and add

```
source <PathToCustomReposiory>/myconfig.sh
```

to your ~/.zshrc file. 

This allows you to further define environment variables.
